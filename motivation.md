**The Problem**

[Awantunai](https://www.awantunai.co.id) provides supply chain business solutions with embedded financing to suppliers and merchants in Indonesia. One potential business solution is tool for suppliers that can predict if a client (i.e. merchant) will consistently come back to buy more FMCG's (fast-moving consumer goods).We want to investigate whether or not we can built a model to accurately predict whether or not an order was placed by a merchant who will eventually turn into a 'churner'. A churner is a merchant who only purchases from a supplier for a short season and never comes back again. 

**The Question**

Based on transaction data, can we predict if a merchant will churn? 

**Background**

If churning can be predicted, marketing resources can be better allocated from the suppliers to the merchants. Identifying churners can give the suppliers information on which merchants to target with discounts or advertisements for client retention. In addition, suppliers can improve management of customer relationships by identifying customers who will likely stop buying, so that actions can be taken to save them. Loyalty can be improved by rewarding loyal customers.
