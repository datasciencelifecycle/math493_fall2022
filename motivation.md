What question(s) are you answering?
What need are you filling?

Based on transaction data, can we predict if a merchant will churn? 

**Background**

Why is this important?
What work has previously been done?

If churning can be predicted, resources can be directed to merchants who are loyal to the suppliers. In addition, suppliers can improve management of customer relationships by identifying customers who will likely stop buying, so that actions can be taken to save them. Loyalty can be improved by rewarding loyal customers.
